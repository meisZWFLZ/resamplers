My goal is to evaluate the performance of different resampling algorithms when used with different input distributions.
 
My current idea is that if I run a resampler many times and create a histogram, I can evaluate how well that histogram matches the input distribution.
I will need to figure out this evaluation step out though, such that it can be done programmatically.
